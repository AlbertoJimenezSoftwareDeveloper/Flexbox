Flexbox

I created this website to put some CSS concepts into practice and to see the power of flexbox.

The main thing I use is flex direction, and some things like margin.
The concepts of main access and cross-axis were put into practice.

You can see the live page at this [link](https://flexbox-production.up.railway.app/) and in this repository.

This is the CSS code we implemented.
(the line in red is an outline class just for debug flex items)
